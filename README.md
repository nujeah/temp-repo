# temp-repo

Today, I learned how to create a repertory of GitHub.
Githeub seemed difficult at first, but it was worth copying while watching the lecture.
I think it will be useful when I share my code or when I'm curious about someone else's code.

The concept of branch was interesting, but it was good that the lecture explained it easily.
While studying C language or Python, I should use Githeub a lot.
